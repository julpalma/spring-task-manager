PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are tasked with building a “Task Manager API + optional frontend”.

It should allow users to:
Create a task with:
title (string, required, max length 100),
optional description (string, up to 500),
status (default: “pending”).
View all tasks, with the ability to:
filter by status,
sort by creation time.
Mark a task as completed.

REQUIREMENTS
Choose the language/framework you are most comfortable with.
You must design clean APIs (REST or GraphQL), or a structured module/library if working in another environment.
Persistence should be considered:
Minimum: in-memory storage.
Bonus: SQLite/Postgres/JSON file.
Add error handling and validation (e.g., empty titles, invalid IDs).
Demonstrate unit tests (for at least core functions).
(Optional) Add one or more of:
simple user authentication (e.g., user ID on each task),
pagination for task listing,
small frontend (web or CLI),
Dockerfile or instructions for running.
STARTER TEMPLATES

Pseudocode Starter (Universal)
DATA STRUCTURE
 Task: id, title, description, status, created_at
 tasks: list of Task
 next_id: int

API ENDPOINTS
 POST /tasks -> validate input, create task
 GET /tasks?status=...&sort=created_at -> list filtered/sorted tasks
 POST /tasks/{id}/complete -> mark as completed
 (Optional) Auth: user_id on each task

TESTS
 - create task with valid/invalid inputs
 - complete task with valid/invalid id
 - list tasks with filters and sorting

Java – Spring Boot
package com.example.taskmanager.model;

import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Task {
   private int id;
   private String title;
   private String description;
   private String status = "pending";
   private LocalDateTime createdAt;

   public Task(int id, String title, String description) {
       this.id = id;
       this.title = title;
       this.description = description != null ? description : "";
       this.createdAt = LocalDateTime.now();
   }

   // getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
